		<h2>Here's a time line of Favaloro's life:</h2>
		<ul id="tl-list">
			<li><strong>1923</strong> - Born in 1923 in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.</li>
			<li><strong>1936</strong> - Is admitted into the Rafael Hernández National College. After graduating from high school, he is admitted to the School of Medicine at the National University of La Plata.</li>
			<li><strong>1949</strong> - Graduates with a medical degree.</li>
			<li><strong>1950</strong> - Moves to a small town named Jacinto Aráuz in La Pampa Province to work as the town's doctor. Marries María Antonia Delgado. He and his brother endeavors to improve the general level of health of that remote region. They trained and educated the general public, teachers, and nurses.</li>
			<li><strong>1962</strong> - Travels to Cleveland to work at the Cleveland Clinic as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team.</li>
			<li><strong>1967</strong> - Performs the first documented saphenous aortocoronary bypass, in a 51-year-old woman with total occlusion of the proximal third of the right coronary artery. 20 days later, angiography showed total reconstruction of the artery. Later, he publishes one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment of Coronary Arteriosclerosis. </li>
			<li><strong>1971</strong> - Returns to Argentina with the dream of developing a center of excellence similar to the Cleveland Clinic, that combined medical attention, research, and education. </li>
			<li><strong>1975</strong> - Bearing that in mind, he founds the Favaloro Fundation in 1975 along with several collaborators. That way, he contributes to raise the standard level of his specialty for the benefit of patients through innumerable courses, seminars, and conferences.</li>
			<li><strong>1980</strong> - Establishes the "Basic Research Laboratory", which ended up becoming Favaloro University in August 1998.</li>
			<li><strong>1992</strong> - Inaugurates the nonprofit Favaloro Foundation Institute of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery in Buenos Aires, with the motto "advanced technology in the service of medical humanism".  The foundation is currently one of the largest institutions dedicated to cardiology in the Americas.</li>
			<li><strong>2000</strong> - With Argentina submerged in a political-economic crisis, and the Foundation in a large debt, an overwhelmed Favaloro takes the terminal decision of commiting suicide at age 77. In a letter, he describes the corruption of the national health system and that he could not fight against it.</li>

		<p>"Rene Favaloro was a true surgical pioneer, a master surgeon and a compassionate human being. He was the first cardiac surgeon to realize the enormous benefit of the saphenous vein graft in coronary artery surgery. He was a brilliant educator. Favaloro taught me cardiac surgery, and he was responsible for training hundreds of surgeons, both here and in Argentina. He was a much sought-after lecturer, and shared his talents and insights with audiences around the world."
